Everything in order.\n\nHere's what it covers:\n\n\u2192 Build your first AI app in the cloud (no install, no terminal)\n\u2192 Install AntiGravity locally (full control on your machine)\n\u2192 The 5-step framework (the system behind every build I ship)\n\u2192 MCP mastery (connect AntiGravity to any tool or database)\n\u2192 NotebookLM integration (give your AI persistent memory)\n\u2192 Website creation (clients can't tell it's AI-built)\n\u2192 Animated UI systems (agency-level design from one prompt)\n\u2192 150+ AI model access (Claude, GPT, Grok \u2014 not just Gemini)\n\n93,000 people have already watched it. It's the most complete free AntiGravity course on YouTube.\n\nI built it because I wasted 100+ hours piecing together scattered guides. Nobody should have to do that.\n\nComment \"MASTERCLASS\" and I'll send you the full link plus my notes on which sections to watch first.\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Repost for priority access, I'll send yours first.\n\nWhich section would save you the most time right now? \ud83d\udc47",

That's it.\n\nOnce I figured that out, I stopped chasing trends and started building businesses.\n\nWhat's the one skill that's built your career?",

Email follow-up: Most people don't buy on the first touch. \n\nConsistent follow-up is boring. It's also where the money is.\n\n3. Reporting: If you can't see it, you can't fix it. \n\nOne dashboard that shows what matters beats 10 tools you never check.\n\n4. Onboarding: First impressions stick. \n\nA smooth onboarding keeps customers longer than any feature ever will.\n\n5. Content repurposing: One YouTube video becomes 7 posts. \n\nOne podcast becomes 10 clips. Leverage compounds.\n\nEverything else? Nice to have.\n\nI wasted months chasing complex AI systems while ignoring these fundamentals.\n\nStart boring.

Semantic is \"find me a cozy 3-bedroom in a good neighbourhood\" (vibes). Lexical is \"find me 123 Oak Street\" (exact address). \n\nHybrid checks both.\n\nThis can have HUGE impacts. \n\nFor example, If a contract lawyer uses semantic search they may not get the actual wording of the clause.\n\n---\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Context Control\n\nWhen we store your data (vectorisation) we do this in chunks.\n\nRAG finds the most relevant chunks for the query.\n\nHow many neighbouring chunks we bring back is the context.\n\nThis is like taking a photo. \n\nNeighbouring chunks = 1 is a tight headshot\n\nNeighboring chunks = 10 is a wide-angle group photo. \n\nSometimes you need to see just the face. Sometimes you need to see who's standing next to them.\n\nIf you had a LONG compliance section of a contract, you'd need more neighbouring chunks (or fewer total chunks).\n\n---\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 RAG Diagnostic \n\nTesting is everything.\n\nLike a mechanic test-driving your car before tuning it. \n\nYou need to see how it actually performs under real conditions, not just assume the default settings work.\n\nThe more you scrutinise the system, the better the results.\n\n---\n\nI've done a FULL masterclass breaking down everything you need to know about RAG.\n\nDrop \"RAG\" below and I'll DM you the link\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Share this with your network to spread the value",
